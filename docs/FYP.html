    <h1>Robotic Camera Project</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        My final year project as part of my degree in Electrical and Electronics engineering, collaborating with 
        <a href="https://www.cacophony.org.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cacophony Project</a> 
        to enhance their thermal camera pest monitoring system. Our goal was to transform their existing still thermal camera into a 
        sophisticated two-axis robotic system. This innovative upgrade allows the system to autonomously track and follow animals 
        in their natural habitat, leveraging the power of the thermal camera's AI detection algorithms for improved monitoring and 
        data collection. This project not only aims to advance wildlife observation but also contributes to effective pest management strategies
        as part of Cacophony's goal of predator-free by the year 2040.

    <h2>Hardware Design Evolution</h2>
    <p>The embedded system was refined over three main itterations. The first; prototype 1 provided a starting point 
        for feild testing to learn how Cacophony's AI software would handle the movement of the robot. Prototype 2 was 
        developed as an a first complete embedded system allowing the testing of individual parts of the system in the lab.
        The final prototype was the design itteration which was developed to fit within the enclosure of the design freaturing
        a smaller overall footprint as well as descete components and ICs rather than the break out development board previously used.

    <h2>Final Prototype and System Integration</h2>
<p>
    Developed a robust Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to facilitate connections between various sensors and outputs. 
    Through multiple iterations, I designed a PCB capable of controlling two stepper motors utilizing the TMC2209 
    stepper drivers. This board not only supports motor control but also features dedicated connectors for seamless 
    communication with a range of sensors, as well as direct connections to the thermal camera board. 
    The design is Integrated into Cacophony's thermal camera system by making use of the existing power PCB. All the 
    thermal cameras connections to the power board are routed through a seperate plane. This design allows the thermal 
    camera system to function normally when the robotic system is connected

    <h2>Overall System</h2>
    <p>
        The overall system has been designed by a final year project group of five members. While individual contributions are not highlighted in this project display, it’s important to recognize the collaborative effort involved in creating this advanced system. 
        My embedded system specifically focuses on motor control, facilitating communication with the thermal camera board. This integration is crucial for the system’s functionality, enabling seamless operation in real-time monitoring and tracking applications.

    <h2>Detection Tracking Video</h2>
    <p>
        In this video, we showcase the final prototype in action, 
        demonstrating Cacophony's AI detection capabilities and the smooth movement of the camera system. 
        Watch as the robotic camera autonomously tracks objects in real-time,
        highlighting the effectiveness of our innovative design in monitoring wildlife.
        This demonstration illustrates the potential applications of our project in
        enhancing pest management strategies.
